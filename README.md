# FocusAnalysis
This project uses computer vision to analyze whether a person is focused on the screen during study sessions. By collecting and processing gaze data, it identifies patterns of attention and distraction. The data is then visualized using graphs to highlight periods of increased or decreased focus, providing insights into study behavior.
